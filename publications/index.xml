      <description>Abstract This paper discusses the positive and negative impacts of the tectonic and topographical patterns in the Indonesian region. The negative impacts are earthquakes and other geological disasters, while the positive impact is the abundance of nickel laterite resources, which can be a natural asset for the country if managed properly. Indonesia has 8% of the world&amp;rsquo;s nickel reserves, making it one of the largest nickel producing countries. However, the low utilization of these resources and the unavailability of smelters in several nickel mining areas indicate the need for geoscientists to improve their understanding of nickel laterite and update their knowledge on efficient exploration techniques.</description>

      <description>Abstract In this recent years, digitalization and automation have been massively transforming global industries to a new era of technology. This also applies in the petroleum industry by utilizing machine learning to aid exploration activities and analyze past data to extract the unseen data. This research implemented the usage of machine learning in petroleum geoscience by utilized the k-nearest neighbor (knn) as the supervised learning model algorithm to predict electrofacies pattern, lithofacies, and depositional environment classification using p-2 and k-1 well data as training dataset and b-1 well data as testing dataset where all the wells are on the same area.</description>
